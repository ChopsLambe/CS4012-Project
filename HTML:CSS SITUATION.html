<p>There is no one single reason for the decline in bee population across the world.In fact it is a
combination of factors. This is alarming, as bee populations are dropping by as much as 30% per
year.</p>

<p class="subtable">Insecticides are perhaps the leading killer of bees. As the name suggests,
insecticides kill off many pollinators, including bee species. Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides
that are giving bees an especially hard time. They are used extensively in modern commercial
agriculture and prove especially toxic to bees. All types of bee are effected by this, both wild
bumblebee and domestic bees kept by beekeepers. When seeds are treated with neonicotinoids, the
chemicals work their way into the pollen and nectar of the plants—which, of course, is bad news for
bees and other pollinators.</p>

This image shows how bee ranges have narrowed and moved north as temperatures increase:

<p class="middle"> Another factor damaging the bee population is climate change. While it is made out that climate change is mostly affecting animals that live in the North and South Poles such as penguins and polar bears, the damage can be seen a lot closer to home. New reports 

<a class= "link" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6244/177">such as this from the journal Science</a> show that bee populations and habitats have been in decline since the
1970's, long before these pesticides came into widespread use.
They took note of shifts in bee ranges and noted over 110 years, there was a change in bees
locations. Southern bees either declined in population, or relocated to higher elevations. On these findings, the report said:
 <blockquote>"These effects are independent of changing land uses or pesticide applications and
underscore the need to test for climate impacts
 at both leading and trailing latitudinal and thermal limits for species."
 </blockquote>

<p class="subpic">Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is an occurence when the majority of the worker
bees in a colony desert the hive, leaving the queen and immatue bees behind, albeit with plenty
food and a few nurse bees to mind the hive. When investigated, this behaviour was seen as strange
and inconsistent with other causes of bee death or disapearances. While the colony can survive for a
while, it cannot sustain without worker bees, and would eventually die off. However, in recent years,
cases of CCD have been on the decline. While it was responsible for 60% of hives lost in 2008, as of
2013 that had dropped to 31.1% and in 2014-15 losses, CCD is not listed as a notable cause.

<div class= "death" >
 <h2 class = "double" >Why does this matter?</h2>
</div>

<p>The decline in bee population should be a cause for worry for everyone. Bees are detrimental to maintaining worldwide food supplies. Their activity is worth around $20 billion to the American market.<a class = "link" href = "http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5201218.stm"> Simon Potts from the University of Reading </a> estimates that the worldwide economic value of
pollinaton is between $37billion and $91billion.
More important than money is food; bees pollinate 71 of the 100 crops that provide 90 percent of
most of the world’s food. This includes food such as apples, pears, peaches, almonds, okra, alfalfa, beans, berries, broccoli, cauliflower, cantaloupes, watermelons, cabbages, peppers, eggplants, tomatoes, citrus fruits, and grapes. May Berenbaum, in an interview with <em>Scientific American</em> says without bees in the world, the only part of a Big Mac left would be the bun! Other effects of the decline of bees would be the ripple in the food chain. Some species of birds feed on bees, and even while none eclusively eat them, their disappearance would be felt.
