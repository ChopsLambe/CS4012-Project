<li>Pollination</li>
<p>At least 30% of Earth's crops and 90% of all plants need cross-pollination, provided primarily by the bee population, to spread and grow. Bees pollinate billions of plants each and every year, and one in every three bites of food consumed depend on pollinators like bees. Delicious crops such as apples, melons, cranberries, asparagus and broccoli would suffer at a depletion in the bees numbers.<br>Below shows a table to demonstrate the influence that bees have on pollinating other such plants:</p>

<table class="TamaraT">
<tr>
	<th>Food</th>

<tr>
	<td>Almonds</td>
	<td>100%</td>

	<td>Oranges</td>

<li>Source of Food</li>
<p><img class="image" src="https://www.mybeeline.co/media/cache/full/posts/removing_bees.jpg" alt="Bee Hive" width="">
	Bees impact the food source as they both produce food and are part of the food chain.<br>Along with humans, critters like birds, opossums and insects also enjoy the sweet taste of honey. If the bee population were to decrease there would be a significant drop in the amount of honey produced and as such there would be less food for these animals. Less commonly known, bees themselves are a part of the food chain. At least 24 species of bird and many spiders and insects, such as dragonflies and praying mantises, prey on bees. Their diet would be greatly affected by this issue as well. 
 </p>

<li>Wildlife Habitats</li>
<p>Bees are vital in the growth of different insect and animal habitats such as tropical forests, savannah woodlands and temperate deciduous forests. Without pollinators, like bees, many plants and trees would not be able to grow and the animals who depend on and habitat them would also disappear. This would be extremely detrimental to their survival.</p>

		<li><p>Ecological farming is much better for wildlife such as bees as it produces less pollution of aerosols and carbon dioxide, it prevents the greenhouse effect and it doesn't generate pollution and waste. Due to these benefits it restores bee populations, improving pollination and in turn crop yields. </p></li>
		<li><p>Pesticides are one of the main causes of bee deaths in the world. Pesticides contain extremely harmful chemicals which accumulate in bees either killing them or weakening them. You can avoid using synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and neonicotinoids and opt for no pesticides or if they are really necessary, natural pesticides instead to protect the bees and other animals.</p></li>
