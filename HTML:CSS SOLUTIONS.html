<li>Pollination</li>
<p>At least 30% of Earths crops and 90% of all plants need cross-pollination, provided primarily by the bee population, to spread and grow. Bees pollinate billions of plants each and every year, and one in every three bites of food consumed depend on pollinators like bees. Delicious crops such as apples, melons, cranberries, asparagus and broccoli would suffer at a depletion in the bees numbers.<br>I have created a table below to demonstrate the influence bees have on pollinating other such plants.</p>

<table>
<tr>
	<th>Food</th>
	<th>Percentage pollinated by bees</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Almonds</td>
	<td>100%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Blueberries</td>
	<td>90%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Oranges</td>
	<td>90%</td>

<tr>
	<td>Mustard</td>
	<td>33%</td>

<tr>
	<td>Sesame seeds</td>
	<td>80%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Pumpkins, Squash and Gourd</td>
	<td>90%</td>
</tr>	
</table>

<li>Source of Food</li>
<p>Bees impact the food source as they both produce food and are part of the food chain.<br>Along with humans, critters like birds, opossums and insects also enjoy the sweet taste of honey. Less commonly known, bees themselves are a part of the food chain. At least 24 species of bird and many spiders and insects, such as dragonflies and praying mantises, prey on bees. </p>

<li>Wildlife Habitats</li>
<p>Bees are vital in the growth of different insect and animal habitats such as tropical forests, savannah woodlands and temperate deciduous forests. Without pollinators, like bees, many plants and trees would not be able to grow and the animals who depend on and habitat them would also disappear.</p>
